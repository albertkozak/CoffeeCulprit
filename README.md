# System Analysis and Design Final Assignment

## Deliverables:

1. Clearly articulate and document the application idea for your passion project. This should be summarized with a few sentences and could be communicated over the course of an elevator ride (ie. an Elevator Pitch).
  * _Idea:
    * _Find the closest coffee shops NOW based on your current location with the Coffee Culprit app. For all those coffee lovers out there that want something a little different rather than your local Starbucks / Tim Hortons. This app focuses on independently run coffee shops vs all the major chains. 

* _User Story: 
  * _Select app, generated list of closest coffee shops appear based on current location
  * _User can adjust search radius or open the map to choose an area
  * _When a shop is selected, business information pops up and an option to open directions via native map app appears

2. Develop a list of functional and non-functional requirements. Remember these are broad concepts that will be more clearly understood through the related features.

  * _Functional Requirements:
    * _Local business data
    * _User location
    * _Search function
    * _Map data

  * _Non-Functional Requirements
    * _Perform local business data search within 10-15 seconds upon loading app
    * _Responsive even if user is multi-tasking between apps
    * _Simple usability, no training required to start using the app (click and go)

3. Create a prioritized feature list. Break your features into “Must Have” and “Nice to Have”.

  * _Features (Must-Have)
    * _Provides closest coffee shops according to current location
    * _List and map view
    * _Display shop information (address, phone number, images, hours of operation)
    * _Increase or decrease search radius settings

  * _Features (Nice to Have)
    * _Unit converter: option to switch between metric and imperial units
    * _Support: option to contact app developer about bug issues
    * _Customer ratings

4. Using a tool (ie. Draw.io or Visio), create an entity relationship diagram.

  * _Refer to attached ERD link (designed with Draw.io): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LrilLxzuZRZKJHFjTram3DBF_ELvEPFL/view?usp=sharing

5. Create a high-fidelity prototype that accurately summarizes the different user flows for your must-have features. 
  * _Refer to attached prototype app images in repository. For full version, please view the submitted zip file in D2L (built with Adobe XD)
