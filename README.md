# System Analysis and Design Final Assignment

## Deliverables:

**1. Clearly articulate and document the application idea for your passion project. This should be summarized with a few sentences and could be communicated over the course of an elevator ride (ie. an Elevator Pitch).**

  * Idea:
    * Find the closest coffee shops NOW based on your current location with the _Coffee Culprit_ app. For all those coffee lovers out there that want something a little different rather than your local Starbucks / Tim Hortons. This app focuses on independently run coffee shops vs all the major chains.

* User Story: 
  * Select app, generated list of closest coffee shops appear based on current location
  * User can adjust search radius or open the map to choose an area
  * When a shop is selected, business information pops up and an option to open directions via native map app appears

**2. Develop a list of functional and non-functional requirements. Remember these are broad concepts that will be more clearly understood through the related features.**

  * Functional Requirements:
    * Local business data
    * User location
    * Search function
    * Map data

  * Non-Functional Requirements:
    * Perform local business data search within _10-15_ seconds upon loading app
    * Responsive even if user is multi-tasking between apps
    * Simple usability, no training required to start using the app (click and go)

**3. Create a prioritized feature list. Break your features into “Must Have” and “Nice to Have”.**

  * Features (Must-Have):
    * Provides closest coffee shops according to current location
    * List and map view
    * Display shop information (address, phone number, images, hours of operation)
    * Increase or decrease search radius settings

  * Features (Nice to Have):
    * Unit converter: option to switch between metric and imperial units
    * Support: option to contact app developer about bug issues
    * Customer ratings

**4. Using a tool (ie. Draw.io or Visio), create an entity relationship diagram.**

  * Refer to attached ERD link (designed with Draw.io):
    * _https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LrilLxzuZRZKJHFjTram3DBF_ELvEPFL/view?usp=sharing_

**5. Create a high-fidelity prototype that accurately summarizes the different user flows for your must-have features.** 
  * Refer to attached prototype app images in repository. For full version, please view the submitted zip file in D2L (built with Adobe XD)

**6. Create a repository in Github to track the progress of your project. Use the Automated Kanban project template.**
  * [X] Create and prioritize issues for your must-have features. Recall that you can also add sub-tasks to an issue to help clearly track what is required to build a feature.
  * [X] Create issues for any other general tasks that are not directly related to a feature (ie. investigating hosting services).
  * [X] Add the deliverables above to a README.md file (use Github-flavoured markdown to format the document in a professional manner).
  * [X] Add _philweier_ to your repository as a contributor.
