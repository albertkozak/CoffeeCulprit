# Passion Project

Coffee Culprit

Concept:

- Mobile app that can locate local coffee shops based on your location (focuses on independently run businesses avoiding major chains such as Starbucks & Tim Hortons) 

Deliverables:

- Clearly articulate and document the application idea for your passion project. This should be summarized with a few sentences and could be communicated over the course of an elevator ride (ie. an Elevator Pitch).
- Develop a list of functional and non-functional requirements. Remember these are broad concepts that will be more clearly understood through the related features.
- Create a prioritized feature list. Break your features into “Must Have” and “Nice to Have”.
- Using a tool (ie. Draw.io or Visio), create an entity relationship diagram.
- Create a high-fidelity prototype that accurately summarizes the different user flows for your must-have features.
- Create a repository in Github to track the progress of your project. Use the Automated Kanban project template.
    a. Create and prioritize issues for your must-have features. Recall that you can also add sub-tasks to an issue to help          clearly track what is required to build a feature.
    b. Create issues for any other general tasks that are not directly related to a feature (ie. investigating hosting                services).
    c. Add the deliverables above to a README.md file (use Github-flavoured markdown to format the document in a professional manner).
    d. Add philweier to your repository as a contributor.
