# System Analysis and Design Final Assignment

## Deliverables:

1. Clearly articulate and document the application idea for your passion project. This should be summarized with a few sentences and could be communicated over the course of an elevator ride (ie. an Elevator Pitch).

  * **_Idea_**:
    * _Find the closest coffee shops NOW based on your current location with the Coffee Culprit app. For all those coffee lovers out there that want something a little different rather than your local Starbucks / Tim Hortons. This app focuses on independently run coffee shops vs all the major chains._

* **_User Story_**: 
  * _Select app, generated list of closest coffee shops appear based on current location_
  * _User can adjust search radius or open the map to choose an area_
  * _When a shop is selected, business information pops up and an option to open directions via native map app appears_

2. Develop a list of functional and non-functional requirements. Remember these are broad concepts that will be more clearly understood through the related features.

  * **_Functional Requirements:_**
    * _Local business data_
    * _User location_
    * _Search function_
    * _Map data_

  * **_Non-Functional Requirements:_**
    * _Perform local business data search within 10-15 seconds upon loading app_
    * _Responsive even if user is multi-tasking between apps_
    * _Simple usability, no training required to start using the app (click and go)_

3. Create a prioritized feature list. Break your features into “Must Have” and “Nice to Have”.

  * **_Features (Must-Have):_**
    * _Provides closest coffee shops according to current location_
    * _List and map view_
    * _Display shop information (address, phone number, images, hours of operation)_
    * _Increase or decrease search radius settings_

  * **Features (Nice to Have):_**
    * _Unit converter: option to switch between metric and imperial units_
    * _Support: option to contact app developer about bug issues_
    * _Customer ratings_

4. Using a tool (ie. Draw.io or Visio), create an entity relationship diagram.

  * **_Refer to attached ERD link (designed with Draw.io):_**
    * _https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LrilLxzuZRZKJHFjTram3DBF_ELvEPFL/view?usp=sharing_

5. Create a high-fidelity prototype that accurately summarizes the different user flows for your must-have features. 
  * _Refer to attached prototype app images in repository. For full version, please view the submitted zip file in D2L (built with Adobe XD)_
